This is an application to interpret the emotion of an emoji. With so many new emojis in usage nowadays it is so hard to predict what a person wants to  convey exactly and also, as a user of these emojis it is important to know when to use an emoji. The emoji meanings are referenced from [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) and stored as a Dictionary in the code. Dictionary is a data structure which basically can store a key value pair. The user can either select a particular emoji from the web page or can paste an emoji inside the text box and the meaning is displayed accordingly below it.
